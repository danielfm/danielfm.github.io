I'm a senior software engineer currently working for
[Globo.com](http://globo.com), the largest media conglomerate in Latin America.

I'm passionate about open source software, programming languages (even the
weird ones), machine learning, and pretty much any computer magic stuff you
might think of.

I currently live in Rio de Janeiro, although I was born and grew up near SÃ£o
Paulo. When I'm not coding (which is most of the time), I like to
watch movies/TV series, play the guitar and have some beer with my friends.
