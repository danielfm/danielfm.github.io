My name is Daniel Martins and I'm a senior software engineer currently working at
[globo.com](http://globo.com), the internet branch of the largest mass media
group of Latin America.

I'm passionate about open source software, programming languages (specially the
weird ones), machine learning, and pretty much any computer science magic you
might think of.

I currently live in Rio de Janeiro, although I was born and grew up near São
Paulo. When I'm not coding, I like to watch movies/TV shows, play the guitar
and have some beer with my friends.

Please check my [portfolio](/portfolio.html) to see what I've been up to, or
