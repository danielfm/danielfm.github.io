My name is Daniel Martins and I'm a senior software engineer currently working
as a SRE at
[Jusbrasil](https://www.jusbrasil.com.br), one of the fastest growing LawTech
startups in Brazil.

I'm passionate about open source software, programming languages (specially the
weird ones), machine learning, and pretty much any computer science magic you
might think of.

I currently live in Rio de Janeiro, although I was born and grew up near SÃ£o
Paulo. When I'm not coding, I like to
[watch TV](https://trakt.tv/user/danielfmt),
[listen to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/danielfmt),
play the guitar, and have some beer with my friends.

Please check my [portfolio](/portfolio.html) to see what I've been up to, or
