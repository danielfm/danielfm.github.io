Besides programming, I have a passion for **music**. For me, music is the
closest thing to magic there is: the ability to make people laugh, cry, have
goosebumps.

Here you can hear some of the recordings I've made at home over the years with
a pretty simplistic setup: a guitar, a USB audio interface, and a MacBook
with Garage Band. All backing tracks I used can be found
[here](http://www.guitarbackingtrack.com).

_Quick note:_ I'm not a musician, and I'm certainly not making any money with
the sounds I publish here. So if you are an idle copyright lawyer, don't need
to bother with me. I'm just a guy that supports music (I still buy CDs, how
cool is that?) and plays the guitar for fun. Please don't ruin it by making
the artists themselves look like douches.

One of the main reasons I bought myself a Fender Strat was to be able to get
tones such as the ones you can find in this piece.

In my opinion, this song, which is part of the
["Wish You Were Here" album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)),
is one of the greatest songs of all time. As a matter of fact, the whole album
is amazing!

In this piece, the guitar I used was equipped with .10-.46 Ernie Ball strings
and tuned half-step down (D#), which made this song easier to play -- except
for the final line, behind the saxophone lead, where I had to use a capo in
order to make some chord fingerings with open strings possible.

Equipment used:

* Fender Stratocaster American Standard
* Tanglewood Speedbar capo
* Tascam US-100 USB audio interface
* MacBook Air 11-inch with Garage Band

### Other Bands

Soon!
