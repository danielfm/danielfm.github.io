One of the main reasons why I bought myself a Fender Strat was to be able to get
tones such as the ones you can find in this piece. For me, this song, which is
part of the
["Wish You Were Here" album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)),
is one of the greatest songs of all time!

In this piece, the guitar I used was equipped with .10-.46 Ernie Ball strings
and tuned half-step down (D#), which made this song easier to play -- except
for the final line, behind the saxophone lead, where I had to use a capo in
order to make some chord fingerings with open strings possible.
