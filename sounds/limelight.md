This one I learned to play in
[Rocksmith](http://rocksmith.ubi.com/rocksmith/en-US/home/index.aspx), a
Guitar Hero type of game but with with real guitars instead of guitar-shaped
joysticks.

At the time I made this recording, I had neither a guitar a guitar equipped
with a tremolo system nor a Whammy pedal, so in order to emulate the "dive bomb"
sort of effect in the solo, I had to break it up into a few parts and mimic the
effect using the good old tuning pegs.
