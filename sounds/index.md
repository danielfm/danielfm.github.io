Besides programming, I have a passion for **music**. For me, music is the
closest thing to magic there is: the ability to make people laugh, cry, have
goosebumps, with nothing but a melody.

Here you can hear some of the recordings I've made at home over the years with
a pretty simplistic setup: a guitar, a USB audio interface, and a MacBook
with Garage Band.

_Quick note:_ I'm not a musician, and I'm certainly not making any money with
the sounds I publish here. So if you are an idle copyright lawyer, don't need
to bother with me. I'm just a guy that supports music (I still buy CDs, how
cool is that?) and plays the guitar for fun. Please don't ruin it by making
the artists themselves look like douches.
