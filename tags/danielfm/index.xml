I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about open source software, programming languages (specially the weird ones), machine learning, and pretty much any computer science magic you might think of.
I currently live in Rio de Janeiro, although I was born and grew up near SÃ£o Paulo.</description></item></channel></rss>
