I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about open source software, programming languages (specially the weird ones), machine learning, and pretty much any computer science magic you might think of.
I currently live in Rio de Janeiro, although I was born and grew up near SÃ£o Paulo. When I&amp;rsquo;m not coding, I like to watch TV, listen to music, play the guitar, and have some beer with my friends.</description></item></channel></rss>
