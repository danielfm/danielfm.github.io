As a contribution to this wonderful initiative, I gather here my impressions regarding some aspects of the course.
Prerequisites Basic probability, matrices, and calculus. According to the course website, this is all you need to know. I would add programming to that list though, since it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to write some tricky programs in order to answer to some questions.</description></item></channel></rss>
