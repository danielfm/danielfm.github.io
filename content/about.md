My name is **Daniel Martins** and I'm a senior software engineer currently
working as a SRE at
[Jusbrasil](https://www.jusbrasil.com.br), one of the fastest growing LawTech
startups in Brazil.

I'm passionate about open source software, programming languages (specially the
weird ones), machine learning, and pretty much any computer science magic you
might think of.

I currently live in Rio de Janeiro, although I was born and grew up near SÃ£o
Paulo. When I'm not coding, I like to
[watch TV](https://trakt.tv/user/danielfmt),
[listen to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/danielfmt),
play the guitar, and have some beer with my friends.

You can find me at [GitHub](https://github.com/danielfm) or
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/danielfmartins). My resume is also available in
[PDF version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielfm/resume/master/resume.pdf).

If you wish to talk to me securely, send me an [email](mailto:hey@danielfm.me)
encrypted with my [PGP public key](/daniel_martins.asc).
